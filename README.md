# Ernest Slave Node Schematics
Eagle files for data collection nodes

[Master Project Repo](https://github.com/rschlaikjer/Ernest)

## What is this
Ernest is the next step of the [ArNest](https://github.com/rschlaikjer/ArNest),
and takes it from a single-location thermostat to a many node system consisting
of a base station and one or more smaller nodes that collect and report
atmospheric data to the base. This way the system can monitor multiple rooms, as
well as the outside conditions.

These EAGLE files show the schematic for hooking up the slave nodes, as well as
a board layout for printing your own slave boards.

For the code to run on the slave nodes,
[see here](https://github.com/rschlaikjer/ernest-slave-code).
