### Multi-node meteorological data collector

## What

Ernest is the next step of the [ArNest](https://github.com/rschlaikjer/ArNest),
and takes it from a single-location thermostat to a many node system consisting
of a base station and one or more smaller nodes that collect and report
atmospheric data to the base. This way the system can monitor multiple rooms, as
well as the outside conditions.

This repo currently just contains the EAGLE files for the smaller data gathering
node.
